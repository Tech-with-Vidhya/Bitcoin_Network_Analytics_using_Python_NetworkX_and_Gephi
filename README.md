# Bitcoin_Network_Analytics_using_Python_NetworkX_and_Gephi

<h4>This project covers the network analysis covering 4 different problem statements and use cases using python NetworkX package, Gephi network analysis tool and Microsoft excel.  Dataset: Dataset includes Bitcoin Trade Transactions for the period between 2011 to 2016.</h4> 
  
<h3>Dataset Representation:</h3> 
<h4>Bitcoin Trade Transactions -> Attributes (Rater, Ratee, Rating and Timestamp)</h4>
  
<h3>Network Formation:</h3>
<h4>For every trade transaction between 2 users in the Bitcoin Network; ratings are recorded and tracked in the system with the corresponding timestamp (Directed Network).</h4>  
  
<h3>Size of the Dataset and Network:</h3> 
<h4>Users/Nodes = 5881 Transactions/Edges = 35592 Ratings (in the range of -10 to +10; where -10 represents the least rating and +10 represents the highest rating)</h4>
